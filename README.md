## Local Server Setup

To run the website locally and access it at a URL, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/

2. Install the dependencies by running:
```
npm install
```

3. Start the server by running:
```
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

This will serve the `index.html` file and allow you to use the website at the local URL.
